#### Introduction

> This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By courseâ€™s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

#### [Week 0: Search](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/0/)

Search problems involve an agent that is given an initial state and a goal state, and it returns a solution of how to get from the former to the latter.
