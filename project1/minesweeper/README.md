## Background

Using propositional logic, the AI will consider its knowledge base and draw inferences based on that knowledge. For a detailed understanding of what information the AI will have access to and how it is represented in code, visit [this](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/#background).

You can try the game yourself by visiting this [Replit](https://replit.com/@AsadAli5/AIMinesweeper) link.

## Run Locally

This folder contains two code files: `runner.py` and `minesweeper.py`. `runner.py` was provided with the distrubution code and implements the graphical interface for the game. `minesweeper.py` contains all the logic for the game itself and for the AI to play the game.

To run the program, `cd` into the directory and install the requirement for this program as below:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the program:

```shell
python3 runner.py
```
